# University Projects - Computer Science (HUJI)

This repository serves as a **Monorepo** (מאגר יחיד המכיל מספר פרויקטים נפרדים) for all academic assignments and laboratory projects completed during my B.Sc. in Computer Science at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

## 📌 Overview
The goal of this repository is to showcase my progress in software development, covering various domains from low-level systems programming to high-level machine learning algorithms. Each directory represents a core course, containing several projects and implementations.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 💻 Systems & Low-Level
* **OS (Operating Systems)**: Focuses on process management, **Multithreading** (הרצת מספר תהליכים במקביל), and memory allocation in C/C++.
* **Nand to Tetris**: Building a modern computer system from the ground up, starting from basic logic gates to a high-level language compiler.
* **C & C++ Projects**: Advanced usage of **Pointers** (משתנים המחזיקים כתובת זיכרון) and performance optimization.

### 🏗️ Software Engineering & Paradigms
* **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Implementation of design patterns and solid principles using Java and C++.
* **Intro to CS**: Fundamental data structures and algorithmic thinking using Python.

### 🤖 Intelligence & Data
* **IML (Introduction to Machine Learning)**: Implementing supervised and unsupervised learning models using **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills

* **Languages**: Python, C, C++, Java, Shell Scripting.
* **Tools**: Git, Valgrind (for memory leak detection), Makefile.
* **Environment**: Developed primarily on **macOS (Apple Silicon M3 architecture)**.

## 🚀 How to Navigate
Each sub-folder contains its own specific `README.md` with:
1. **The Objective**: What the project aimed to solve.
2. **The Logic**: Why a specific algorithm or data structure was chosen.
3. **Execution**: Instructions on how to compile and run the code.
