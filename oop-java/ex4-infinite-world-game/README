In this package we created a few classes. The Tree class is the main one.
It creates a full tree, including the trunk, the leaves and one fruit.
It has a method that returns all parts of the tree in a list.
The Leaf class represents one green square leaf. The Fruit class is a game object
that can disappear when the avatar touches it and comes back after some time.
The Flora class is responsible for creating many trees in a range of X values,
using the ground height and some randomness.

The classes work together like this. The Tree class creates leaves and fruit inside it.
The Flora class uses the Tree class to create full trees. All the classes extend GameObject,
but they are not in an inheritance chain. The connection between them is by using each other
, like composition.

We also used a design pattern. The Tree class uses a factory method – it has a static function
that builds and returns a full tree. The Flora class is also similar to a factory because it
creates many trees. This makes the code easier to use again and keeps each class responsible
for one job.
